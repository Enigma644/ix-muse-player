class TypeMarshaller(object):
    """ Base class for marshallers of Python types.

    Base class providing the class interface for marshallers of Python
    types to/from disk. All marshallers must inherit from this
    class and override some of its methods and attributes. Just
    replicating its functionality is not enough. This includes several
    attributes that are needed in order for reading/writing methods to
    know if it is the appropriate marshaller to use and methods to
    actually do the reading and writing.

    Marshallers are supported for types whose modules/packages may not
    be present (only guaranteed modules/packages are the Python runtime,
    numpy, and h5py). Obviously, if such a type is run into for writing,
    the needed modules are there. However, if such a type is found in a
    file for reading, it still needs to be read regardless of whether
    the required modules are present or not. If the required modules are
    there, the data will be read accurately using the ``read``
    method. However, if one or more of the required modules are missing,
    the data will be read approximately/inaccurately using the
    ``read_approximate`` method is used, which must return an
    approximation of the data utilizing standard Python types or numpy
    types. A good example of a situation where this would be needed
    would be reading back a scipy sparse type when scipy is not present
    and thus it must be approximated (say, a conversion to a dense array
    or just the fields specifying it in a ``dict``). Note that for types
    not in the main Python runtime or numpy, their types in ``types``
    must be specified in ``str`` form including module. For example,
    ``collections.deque`` is ``'collections.deque'``.

    Whether the marshaller can read types accurately with ``read`` or
    approximately with ``read_approximate`` is determined by whether the
    parent modules in ``required_parent_modules`` is/are present or
    not. If ``read`` is called, all the modules in ``required_modules``
    will be loaded first (no additional latency). The ``read`` method
    must locally load the modules, though, in order to use them.

    Note that it may be convenient for a marshaller that handles types
    in the main Python runtime but in modules that are rather large to
    use specify their types as ``str`` in ``types`` and put the required
    modules in ``required_parent_modules`` to not load those modules
    unless they are necessary - lazy loading essentially.

    Subclasses should run this class's ``__init__()`` first
    thing, set all attributes except ``type_to_typestring`` and
    ``typestring_to_type`` appropriately, and then call
    ``update_type_lookups()`` to set the two previous
    attributes. Inheritance information is in the **Notes** section of
    each method. Generally, ``read``, ``write``, and ``write_metadata``
    need to be overridden and the different attributes set to the proper
    values. ``read_approximate`` needs to be overridden for marshallers
    meant to handle types not from the main Python runtime and not from
    numpy.

    For marshalling types that are containers of other data, one will
    need to appropriate read/write them with the lowlevel functions
    ``utilities.read_data`` and ``utilities.write_data``.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.2
       All marshallers must now inherit from this class.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.2
       Attributes were added, ``read_approximate`` was added, call
       signatures of the methods, and the initialization procedure were
       changed.
