How to Contribute to MusePlayer
===============================
-------------------------------

Contributing Code
-----------------
-----------------

To contribute code to the muse-player project, you need to follow the standard fork and pull request workflow. That is: 

1. Clone the museplayer repo onto your machine and create a new branch to develop your feature on. 
2. Create a remote fork of the muse-player repo to push your changes to once they are ready.
3. Remember to rebase your fork on the master branch of the muse-player repo before you submit your pull request. This will
help to avoid messy merging scenarios.
4. Submit a detailed pull request against the master branch of the muse-player repo.


Code Guidelines
---------------
---------------

Pull requests will be reviewed with the following guidelines in mind:

- Follow the style conventions already present in the code.
- Test your changes. If this means writing new tests, then do that. Pull requests with untested/untestable/failing changes will not be approved.
- Write detailed commit messages. If your changes are associated with a specific issue, include the issue id. The conventional approach to good
commit messages is to write a short one-line summary of the changes on the first line of the commit message file and then include a more detailed
description on the lines below. 


Bug Reports & Feature Requests
------------------------------
------------------------------

Use the [Issue Tracker](https://bitbucket.org/interaxon/museplayer/issues) to report bugs and request new features.

When reporting a bug or requesting a feature:

- Make sure the issue has not already been identified by searching the [Issue Tracker](https://bitbucket.org/interaxon/museplayer/issues) and the [Muse developer forums](forum.choosemuse.com)
- Make sure you are working on the latest version of the muse-player master branch. Your issue may have been addressed since you last pulled.
- Describe your issue **clearly**, **carefully**, and **in detail**. 
  
    - If it's a **bug**, that means: 
        - State your problem 
        - The context of the problem (muse-player version,
OS, the model of your machine, and any other relevant basic details)
        - What you were attempting to achieve 
        - How exactly you triggered the problem 
        - ...and what you tried to solve it. 

    - If it's a **feature request**, that means: 
        - Carefully describe why the feature should be added. 
        - Explain how it would benefit the majority of users.
